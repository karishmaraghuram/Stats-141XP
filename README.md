Questions of Interest: 
1.      Does an abnormal Epworth Scale score correlate with any abnormalities in the typical indices of sleep studies, e.g. sleep disordered breathing, periodic limb movements, sleep stage, etc.?  Would also stratify this by age and gender.

2.      Does the degree of hypoxemia (low oxygen) defined using % time with an oxygen saturation less than 88 %, duration and frequency of respiratory events,

3.      Correlate with burden of cardiac arrhythmia (duration and frequency of abnormal heart rhythm).  Detail data regarding the respiratory metrics can be obtained directly from the sleep study (poly Smith) software.  In regards to cardiac arrhythmia, this can be counted directly from the sleep study though I do not believe in is typically reported.  The technicians comment on the amount of arrhythmia in the reports, a grade can be applied to this classification data.

4.      Does the frequency and duration of periodic limb movements of sleep correlate with the frequency and duration of cardiac arrhythmia?

5.      We also do not have reliable normal ranges for the arousal index during a polysomnogram.  Comparing arousal indices in distinct patient subgroups:  Normal study, study with sleep apnea stratified by severity, study with periodic limb movements, study with both sleep apnea and periodic limb movements.
